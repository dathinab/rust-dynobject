Currently access is like this

match obj[key].as_ref::<type> {
	Some(data_ref) => ...
	None => ...
}

but replacing is like this:

obj.set_property(&key, value)

and creation and deletion is like this

obj.create_property(key, value)
obj.remove_property(key)

also everything returns the passed value back if failing but not create_property!!

IDEA:>
	atlast refaktor create_property
