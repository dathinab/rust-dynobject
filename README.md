# dynobject
Kind of dynamic Objects for rust. Allowing to create, change and access typed properties with runtime type checks

**Note:** Rust has perfectly fine mechanismen to do mostly everything without refering to such a roundabout _crates_ like _dynobject_

# TODO
1. add documentation
2. add usage example to readme
